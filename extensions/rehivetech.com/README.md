PIXLA from RehiveTech is an ecosystem used for remote monitoring and maintenance of IoT Gateways or all Linux based devices in general. Such device with the PIXLA client software installed reports user specified data securely to the PIXLA cloud. All measured data are then available via PIXLA web interface (www.pixla.online) from computer, tablet or even smartphone. Moreover, the solution enables operators to address most of the necessary operating interventions remotely via the same web interface.

### Step 3
Each registered gateway is identified by an unique identifier called **token** that can distinguish one particular device or also the whole group of devices. Copy the installation command to your device client console where you must be logged as a root user or run the command with `sudo`. Do not forget that the device must be connected to the internet.
