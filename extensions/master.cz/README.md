# IoT Starter Kit - mobile app

https://www.master.cz

We are Master Internet. We have background in providing data centre services and in creating mobile apps that help people all over the world. When you combine these two types of knowledge with seasoned developers and software engineers, there aren’t many things that can go wrong. 

In cooperation with IQRF, we’ve created an [IoT Starter app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.iqrfalliance.demo&hl=cs) to go along with the IoT Starter Kit. It’s modifiable and easily cooperates with sensors from the IoT Starter Kit. That means you can control all of these sensors by tapping away on your phone, turning them on and off or reading the values:

- **DDC - SE**

Allows you to measure temperature, light intensity and the voltage of the potentiometer.

- **DDC - RE** 

A relay kit where you control connected equipment using two relay switches.

- **Cobra**

A smart power strip.

- **NLII - CO<sub>2</sub>**

Measures humidity, CO<sub>2</sub> level and temperature for you.

- **DATMO**

Control your lighting. Turn the lights on, off or dim them altogether.


The IoT Starter app is a perfect example of combining all of our skill sets. We’ve created it to specifically work with IoT Starter kit by IQRF. But we can do even more for you!

The IoT Starter app is just the first step into a fully customizable app. We can craft the app to your specific needs, working on any platform. Android, Apple, Windows.
