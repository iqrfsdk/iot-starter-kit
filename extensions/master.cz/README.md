# 	IQRF Network Manager - mobile app

https://www.masterapp.cz

We are MasterAPP, a younger division of Master Internet. We have background in providing data centre services and in creating mobile apps that help people all over the world. When you combine these two types of knowledge with seasoned developers and software engineers, there aren’t many things that can go wrong. 

In cooperation with IQRF, we’ve created [IQRF Network Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.iqrfalliance.demo&hl=cs). It’s modifiable and easily cooperates with all devices in the IQRF repository. 

The app features a home screen filled with all the necessary information - connected devices, their online or offline status, and sensor information or switches for activation. You can access  your device sensor information about temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, light dimmers – you name it, IQRF Network Manager gives you access to all these devices. Create a smart building by using your phone!

Configure and optimize the network according to your needs. Use automatic or manual configuration - it’s easy and comfortable either way. You can rename devices, bond and unbond them, and also renumerate sensors to create the perfect gateway to a smart home. The Smart Connect feature (currently in Beta) was presented at the IQRF Summit 2018. Smart Connect allows users to add devices to the wireless network via unique QR codes for every device meant for bonding.

The IQRF Network Manager is a perfect example of combining all of our skill sets. We’ve created it to specifically work with IQRF development sets stored in their device repository. But we can do even more for you!

We can craft the app to your specific needs, working on any platform. Android, Apple, Windows.
