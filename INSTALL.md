* Part 1: [Build your IQRF network](https://gitlab.iqrf.org/alliance/iot-starter-kit/tree/master/install/PART1-NET.md)
* Part 2: [Install your IQRF gateway](https://gitlab.iqrf.org/alliance/iot-starter-kit/tree/master/install/PART2-GW.md)
* Part 3: [Connect to cloud](https://gitlab.iqrf.org/alliance/iot-starter-kit/tree/master/install/PART3-EXT.md)

Create your IQRF network, install and configure your IQRF gateway, set the MQTT connection to the selected cloud. The prepared tutorials help you with the basic settings of all parts.

Once you have the basic communication functional, it is very easy to extend your basic development IQRF UP Iot Starter Kit to other external devices (sensors, actuators). You can create new projects for IoT with them.
